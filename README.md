# LAB

Welcome to the LAB (Libroru's Admin Bot) Bot! This Bot is in heavy development right now so there is not much content and there are not much commands to do. Everything is written in discord.py and is coming with heavy downtimes right now. If you want to deal with that, then invite him :).

What you can do right now:

!!spaceforme (message) -- this will make space between the single characters. 

!!ping -- this will send you a pong message with the latency to the bot.

!!help -- sends a help message

As you can see there is not much to do right now and I'm trying to fix everything to setup the rich presence. If you invited him to your server, I hope that you have much fun with it :).
